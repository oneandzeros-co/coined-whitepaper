## 📖 About

Coined introduces a protocol for **permissionless social tokenization** — a system where the public, not creators, initiate token launches based on cultural relevance and online presence. No teams, no gatekeeping, no permission required.

This whitepaper outlines:
- A fair launch mechanism tied to public signal (e.g., tweets)
- Escrow-based fee distribution between holders and public figures
- Claim system for creators via Twitter OAuth
- A future where **influence becomes infrastructure**
